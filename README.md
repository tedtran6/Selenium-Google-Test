# Selenium-Google-Test

This is a test of the selenium library for python. The main purpose of this code is to practice and exercise with using the selenium library in python. What this program does is:
1. Opens up Google Chrome
2. Searches "Hello"
3. Appends " It's me!" to the search
4. Searches for "Hello It's me!"

There is not very intense testing here done. However, I may test this on my ecommerce website I built.
